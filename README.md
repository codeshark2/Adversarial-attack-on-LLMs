# Evaluating the Resilience of Large Language Models (LLMs) Against Adversarial Attacks

## Overview:
In this project, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the resilience of Large Language Models (LLMs) to adversarial attacks. Our focus was primarily on models VICUNA and LLAMA 2-7B, aiming to understand their robustness in real-world scenarios where adversaries attempt to manipulate model behavior through carefully crafted inputs.

## Key Objectives:
1. **Resilience Evaluation**: Our primary objective was to assess the ability of LLMs, specifically VICUNA and LLAMA 2-7B, to withstand adversarial attacks effectively.

2. **Methodology Employed**:
   - **Dataset Selection**: We employed rigorous methodologies, leveraging widely-recognized Natural Language Inference (NLI) and SuperGLUE datasets. These datasets are established benchmarks for evaluating language understanding capabilities.
   - **Analytical Tools**: To ensure robust evaluation, we utilized analytical tools such as PromptBench and JAILBREAK. These tools provided insights into LLM performance under adversarial conditions and helped in identifying vulnerabilities.

3. **Parameter Impact Analysis**:
   - We conducted an in-depth analysis to understand the impact of key parameters, including Top-K and temperature sampling, on the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. These parameters play a crucial role in shaping model behavior and resilience.
   - By highlighting their influence, we aimed to provide actionable insights for enhancing model robustness against adversarial threats.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Our study yielded valuable insights into both the strengths and vulnerabilities of VICUNA and LLAMA 2-7B when subjected to adversarial situations.
   - These insights aid in understanding the performance of LLMs under challenging conditions and offer recommendations for mitigating vulnerabilities and improving overall resilience.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, our project sheds light on the resilience of Large Language Models against adversarial attacks, with a specific focus on VICUNA and LLAMA 2-7B. Through rigorous evaluation methodologies and parameter analysis, we provide valuable insights that contribute to advancing the field of adversarial robustness in natural language processing.
